# INSTALLATION 

[express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) The application's folder structure follows the Model-View-Controller paradigm by using the handlebars package.

```
npm install express-handlebars
```

[MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)

```
npm install --save mysql2
```

[Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.

```
npm i sequelize
```

[dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to use environment variables.

```
npm install dotenv --save
```

[bcrypt package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to hash passwords.

```
npm install bcrypt
```

[express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) **Note**: The package stores the
session data on the client in a cookie. When you are idle on the site for more than a set time, the
cookie will expire and you will be required to log in again to start a new session. This is the
default behavior and you do not have to do anything to your application other than implement the npm
package.

```
npm install express-session
```

[connect-session-sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize) packages to add authentication.

```
npm install connect-session-sequelize
