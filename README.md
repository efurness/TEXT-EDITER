# DESCRIPTION 

This is a single-page application using an `IndexedDB API` with ability to run live or offline in an internet browser.  It offers the ability to be installed as a Progressive Web Application.  Users can create notes or code snippets when they're are traveling or in the field because of data persistence.  A `manifest.json` file is made using the `WebpackPwaManifest` plug-in.  Additionally, a `service worker` is created using `workbox` that caches static assets.  The application is deployed to Heroku.
